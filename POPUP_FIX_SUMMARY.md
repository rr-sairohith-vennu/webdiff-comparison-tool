# Popup Redirect Fix - Summary

## Problem

When comparing production vs preview URLs, the **production URL was showing the homepage instead of the Cash Back Activity page**.

### Root Cause:

The comparison tool was automatically closing popups on the page. When it closed a popup on the production site (likely an auth/login modal), **the popup closure triggered a redirect to the homepage**.

**From the logs:**
```
✅ Popup closed using selector: [aria-label*="close" i]
✅ Total popups closed: 1
```

After closing this popup, the browser was redirected from:
- ❌ `/account/cash-back-activity` → Redirected to homepage

While the preview URL worked fine because it didn't have this auth popup.

## Solution

**Disabled popup handling** to prevent auth redirects.

### Change Made:

**File:** [server.js](server.js:48-54)

**Before:**
```javascript
async handlePopups(page, url) {
  // Automatically close any popup with close button
  for (const selector of popupSelectors) {
    await element.click(); // This was causing redirect!
  }
}
```

**After:**
```javascript
async handlePopups(page, url) {
  // DISABLED: Popup closing causes auth redirects on production site
  console.log(`⏭️  Popup handling disabled (prevents auth redirects)`);
  await page.waitForTimeout(2000); // Just wait for page to stabilize
  console.log(`✅ Page loaded without closing popups`);
  return; // Skip popup handling
}
```

## Result

Now both URLs should load correctly:
- ✅ Production URL: Loads Cash Back Activity page (with popup visible)
- ✅ Preview URL: Loads Cash Back Activity page

The popup will remain visible in screenshots, but the page content will be correct.

## How to Test

1. **Refresh browser:** http://localhost:4000
2. **Run comparison** with your prod/preview URLs
3. **Check screenshots:** Both should show the Cash Back Activity page now

## Trade-offs

**Before (with popup closing):**
- ✅ Clean screenshots (no popups)
- ❌ Production URL redirected to homepage

**After (without popup closing):**
- ✅ Both URLs load correct pages
- ⚠️ Popups may appear in screenshots
- ✅ Comparison works correctly

## If You Need Popup Closing

If you want to close popups without causing redirects, you can:

1. **Manual popup closing:** Close the popup manually in browser first, then copy the URL
2. **Custom selector:** Only close specific non-auth popups (requires knowing which selectors are safe)
3. **Accept popups:** Let them appear in screenshots and ignore them during comparison

## Server Status

✅ Running on http://localhost:4000 with popup handling disabled
✅ Production URL should now load correctly
✅ Ready to test!

## To Revert (If Needed)

If you want the old behavior back:

```javascript
// In server.js, line 51-54, remove these lines:
console.log(`⏭️  Popup handling disabled`);
await page.waitForTimeout(2000);
console.log(`✅ Page loaded without closing popups`);
return; // Remove this line to re-enable popup closing
```

Then restart the server.
